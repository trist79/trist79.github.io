    <h6 lass="w3-opacity"><i>Galactic Federation of Star Systems</i></h6>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The Galactic Federation of Star Systems, or the GFSS for short, is a group of sovereign star systems in the Orion Galaxy who work together to maintain order throughout the galaxy. They are run out of the 2nd largest artificial planet in the Orion Galaxy, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_Cassus">Globus Altum</a> inside of the Alpha Corvi system (21.25 <a href="http://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Parsec">Parsecs</a> <a href = "http://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Galactic_Directions">Spinward-Spinward-Rimward</a> of the Eroth System, 0.13 Parsecs inside the Spinward side of the Corvus Nebula). <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The GFSS is run with a Republic governmental system ruled by a Council of Leaders containing the heads of the Sovereign systems that make up the GFSS. There are an odd number of representatives in the Council of Leaders to prevent ties in major decisions. Some of the representatives of larger and more powerful systems represent 2 votes, while some smaller represent 1/2 a vote. The GFSS exists to deal with galaxy-wide wars, epidemics, and court cases. The GFSS Grand Court is made up of the 9 major representatives, and decide the fate the largest cases in the galaxy. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Punishments are generally swift and severe, consisting of being excommunicated to intergalactic space, termination, or rarely sent to Galactic Federation Prison.
    </p>
    <h6 lass="w3-opacity"><i>The United Eroth Federation</i></h6>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The United Eroth System or UEF, whose history is described <a href = "#documents">below</a>, is made up of the Arkai Corporation, the Ombrian Empire, and the Cyprian Empire. Centered in the Eroth System on their home-world Cyprus, the UEF is a Republican government run by 3 democratically elected officials, one from the AC of its members (AC, OE, and CE). These 3 representatives have equal voting power on issues and decisions facing the Eroth system or its inhabitants. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The UEF is currently undergoing a number of projects. The first project they are currently working on is a long-term project to restore the habitability of the Home-Planet Arkeera after the swift deterioration of its ecosystem. The second project is entitled "The Atlas Project", and is a massive engineering venture to create the largest artificial structure in the Eroth System. This mega-spacestation will eventually become the home of the UEF government and become the capital of the star system. The third project the UEF is involved in is the migration of Arkeera's Moon "Nerv" from the orbit around Arkeera to an orbit around Cyprus. This is still in the planning stages, but is expected to be completed within the decade. The last project is the development and expansion of the Arkai Corporation's Cronos Fleet, a largescale fleet of Cronos-class mega-starships.
    </p>
    <h6 lass="w3-opacity"><i>The Arkai Corporation</i></h6>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The Arkai Corporation, the leading military force of the United Eroth Federation, is based out of Nerv, Arkeera's inhabited moon, as well as various bases throughout the system. The current leader of the Arkai Corporation is run by the Grand Admiral Whitestar (in charge of base operations and production) and the Grand General Ak'Uthuk (in charge of military strategy and the Cronos Fleet). <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;This Corporation is based less off of democratic elections and more after a promotion and merit based hierarchy. Grand Admiral and Grand General are positions elected by popular vote of all members of the Corporation ranked higher than Lieutenant Commander / Major, are elected every 8 years, and can serve up to 2 terms. The Grand Admiral and Grand General are promotions available for Admirals and Generals with 3 stars or higher. The current representative for the UEF is the Grand Admiral Whitestar.
    </p>
    <h6 lass="w3-opacity"><i>Ombrian Empire</i></h6>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The Ombrian Empire has been leading the Arkeeran people since its inception in BNE 0025. The Ombrian Empire is solidly built on a Democratic Republic, with a Parliamentary system as the executive branch. Parliament members hold 12 year terms, are elected by popular vote, and are not limited on amount of terms they serve. The head of state of the OE is the leader of the parliament, the Prime Minister. Prime Ministers are elected democratically from members of parliament by the main populous. They hold 8 year terms and can hold up to 4 consecutive terms. The current holder of this position is Prime Minister Oph Imisea. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;There are also smallers sets of governing bodies for the different locations in the Eroth system. These smaller governmental systems are similar to the parliamentary system, but based on a smaller council of elected officials who serve for varieties of time spans, from 2 to 32 years. 
    </p>
    <h6 lass="w3-opacity"><i>Cyprian Empire</i></h6>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The Cyprian Empire, based out of Cyprus, is the newest addition to the UEF despite having joined over 150 years ago. Originally only Ysoki, the Cyprians have vastly expanded to include a myriad of races from inside and outside of the Eroth system. Their governmental system is based similarly off of a monarchy, but with some ideas of a democratic republic thrown in. Their leader is decided by popular vote every 6 years, but there has never been a time where someone outside of the royal family has been elected. <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Despite this somewhat monarchic system, the Cyprians continue to be an empire of happy, safe, and technologically advanced people. The majority of their home planet is heavily forested, but still features massive mega-metropolises densely packed with skyscrapers and vastly complicated underground tunnel networks. Pictured at the top of the homepage is the entrance to the largest city in Cyprus, Kotashi.
